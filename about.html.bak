            <p>
                Getting into saltwater aquariums as a hobby can be a daunting task.
                To get started one needs to know what fish and corals to pursue, what water chemistry should look like, what to feed, minimum tanks size, and where to place corals within a tank.
                The content is this website intends to answer these questions for individuals just getting into this hobby.
                The site contains 3 main tabs to provide data on: beginner fish, beginner corals, and an introduction to water chemistry.
            </p>
            <h2>Charts</h2>
            <p>
                The Chemistry tab contains charts to display the upper and lower limits of 10 tank chemistry key characteristics.
                A random number generator was used to populate demo values on these charts to represent fluctuations throughout a 24-hour cycle.
                These demo values should be updated to represent real-world data in future updates.
            </p>
            <h2>Responsiveness</h2>
            <p>
                To account for responsiveness of the website, containers were put in place to ensure left-to-right scrolling is minimized based on screen-width resolution.
                Key elements resize based on the following screen-width attributes:
                Max-width of 600 pixels, min-width of 600 pixels, min-width of 768 pixels, min-width of 992 pixels, min-width of 1200 pixels, and min-width of 1900 pixels.
            </p>
            <h2>Usability</h2>
            <p>
                To ensure usability and a good user experiencea a menu bar is implemented as the topmost layer at the top of the screen.
                Styling has been implemented to change colors of the menu items when a user hovers over an item, and when a user selects an item.
                This ensures the user is aware of what page they are on/going to and how to navigate back to a previous page.
            </p>
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>This website was designed with the following guidelines in mind.</p>
            <p>
                1. Simple Navigation: Navigation is completed by a static menu bar on the topmost layer at the top of the screen.
                Styling has been implemented to change colors of the menu items when a user hovers over an item, and when a user selects an item.
                This ensures the user is aware of what page they are on/going to and how to navigate back to a previous page.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Standard Page Structure: The look and feel of each page is identical and user interactions are standard across all pages.
                This provides the user with a familiar look where all navigation elements operate in the same manner on all pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Styling: Dynamic styling was implemented to ensure the site is mobile friendly.
                ~50% of web traffic now-a-days comes from mobile devices.
                Elements will resize based on screen-width to minimize the need for horizontal scrolling on small portrait displays, such as cell phones, while taking advantage of larger screens when viewed on a desktop monitor.
